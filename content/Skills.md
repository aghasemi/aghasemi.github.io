I have done many types of projects, from desktop GUIs (Swing, JavaFX) to large-scale application servers to scientific computing (Machine learning and data engineering using Spark, Kafka, SMILE, and DL4J, NLP using CoreNLP, Computational Geometry, Computer Vision using OpenCV, …) and Android development.
- __Python:__ I have a broad experience in writing prototypes and PoCs and conducting analyses for machine learning and data analysis tasks using various tools and libraries including TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy/SciPy, NLTK, and XGBoost, as well as automation scripts for software environments such as the Blender 3-D rendering software.
- __MATLAB:__ Proficient. I have used MATLAB in research since 2007. I have done tens of small and medium-level projects, mostly in the machine learning, signal processing and computer vision areas, but also in simulation and optimization.
- __JavaScript:__ Experienced. I have used JavaScript in server-side programming (Node.js and Meteor) and Google Chrome extension development as well as client-side scripting.
- __SQL:__ Experienced. I used plain SQL and JDBC in small and medium-sized projects from 2008 to 2011. I have experiences in database design (ER diagrams, …) as well and have taught undergraduate database courses for numerous classes from 2009 to 2011.
