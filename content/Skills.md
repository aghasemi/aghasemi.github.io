- __Data Engineering & Databases:__ Experienced in Apache Spark, Kafka, Hadoop, SQL, ERD, NoSQL (MongoDB, Firebase), Teradata, Oracle.
- __Image & Signal Processing:__ Expert in Multi-Camera Image Analysis, 3-D Reconstruction, Camera & Visual Localisation, Super-resolution (OpenCV, MATLAB).
- __Scientific Computing:__ Expert in Numerical & Blackbox Optimisation, Convex & Non-Convex problems (MATLAB, Python, R)
- __Web Application Development:__ I have done small and medium-level projects using various web frameworks including Symfony, Spring, Struts2, GWT, Grails, ….
- __NoSQL:__ I like NoSQL databases. I have been using Firebase and MongoDB in my projects (Android and client-side JavaScript) since 2014.
- __Operating Systems:__ I have worked with various flavours of Linux (Debian, Fedora, Mint, Ubuntu) and Windows for both personal and professional use. I currently administer a virtual private server (VPS) running Debian for personal purposes. I also have experiences with Win32 programming.
- __Version Control and Build Automation Systems:__ I have worked with Git and SVN for version controlling in the projects I've been involved. I'm also a user of Maven and Gradle for managing dependencies and build automation in the Java environment.

Programming Languages
------------

- __Java:__ Expert. Java has been my primary programming language since 2005. I have done many types of projects, from desktop GUIs (Swing, JavaFX) to large-scale application servers to scientific computing (Machine learning and data engineering using Spark, Kafka, SMILE, and DL4J, NLP using CoreNLP, Computational Geometry, Computer Vision using OpenCV, …) and Android development.
- __Python:__ Experienced. I have a broad experience in writing prototypes and PoCs and conducting analyses for machine learning and data analysis tasks using various tools and libraries including TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy/SciPy, NLTK, and XGBoost, as well as automation scripts for software environments such as the Blender 3-D rendering software.
- __Scala:__ Experienced. I have used Scala extensively for Data Engineering ptojects using mainly Apache Spark and Apachae Kafka.
- __JavaScript:__ Experienced. I have used JavaScript in server-side programming (Node.js and Meteor) and Google Chrome extension development as well as client-side scripting.
- __MATLAB:__ Proficient. I have used MATLAB in research since 2007. I have done tens of small and medium-level projects, mostly in the machine learning, signal processing and computer vision areas, but also in simulation and optimization.
- __SQL:__ Experienced. I have used plain SQL and JDBC in small and medium-sized projects and also in data analytics and visualisation. I have experiences in database design (ER diagrams, …) as well and have taught undergraduate database courses for numerous classes from 2009 to 2011.
- __PHP, Groovy:__ I did medium-level projects in PHP and Groovy from 2009 to 2011.
- __C/C++:__ Brief experience. I have been programming in C/C++ on and off since high-school (circa 2002).
- __LaTeX:__ Fluent and experienced. I have been actively using and developing LaTeX since 2007 for every type of document (Reports, posters, presentation slides,…).
